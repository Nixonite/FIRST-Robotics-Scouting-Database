<h2>How do I understand the "Ranking" page?</h2>
<hr>
<p>It sorts from lowest to highest value in each category. Values don't mean the same thing in each category. A "4" in penalties is not good, but a "4" in score is awesome. There's one line serving as a key or legend to understand what you're looking for in teams located underneathe each category.
